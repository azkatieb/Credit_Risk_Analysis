# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis:
This analysis consisted of creating supervised machine learning models that could accurately predict the credit risk of the dataset provided. 

The machine learning models that we used were: 
- Oversampling (RandomOverSampler)
- SMOTE Oversampler
- Undersampling (ClusterCentroids)
- Combination Over and Under Sampling (SMOTEENN)
- Balanced Random FOrest Classifier
- Easy Ensemble Classifier

## Results:

1. Oversampling

    Balanced Accuracy Score - 64.87%

    Precision Score - 0.98%

    Recall Score - 61%
